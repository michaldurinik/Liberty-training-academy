Messenger</i>
</p>
<h4>LEONATO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">I learn in this letter that Don Peter of Arragon<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">comes this night to Messina.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>Messenger</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">He is very near by this: he was not three leagues off<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">when I left him.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>LEONATO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">How many gentlemen have you lost in this action?<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>Messenger</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">But few of any sort, and none of name.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>LEONATO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">A victory is twice itself when the achiever brings<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">home full numbers. I find here that Don Peter hath<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">bestowed much honour on a young Florentine called Claudio.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>Messenger</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">Much deserved on his part and equally remembered by<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">Don Pedro: he hath borne himself beyond the<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">promise of his age, doing, in the figure of a lamb,<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">the feats of a lion: he hath indeed better<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">bettered expectation than you must expect of me to<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">tell you how.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>LEONATO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">He hath an uncle here in Messina will be very much<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">glad of it.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>Messenger</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">I have already delivered him letters, and there<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">appears much joy in him; even so much that joy could<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">not show itself modest enough without a badge of<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">bitterness.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>LEONATO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">Did he break out into tears?<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>Messenger</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">In great measure.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>LEONATO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">A kind overflow of kindness: there are no faces<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">truer than those that are so washed. How much<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">better is it to weep at joy than to joy at weeping!<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>BEATRICE</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">I pray you, is Signior Mountanto returned from the<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">wars or no?<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>Messenger</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">I know none of that name, lady: there was none such<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">in the army of any sort.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>LEONATO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">What is he that you ask for, niece?<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>HERO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">My cousin means Signior Benedick of Padua.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>Messenger</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">O, he's returned; and as pleasant as ever he was.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>BEATRICE</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">He set up his bills here in Messina and challenged<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">Cupid at the flight; and my uncle's fool, reading<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">the challenge, subscribed for Cupid, and challenged<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">him at the bird-bolt. I pray you, how many hath he<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">killed and eaten in these wars? But how many hath<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">he killed? for indeed I promised to eat all of his killing.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>LEONATO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">Faith, niece, you tax Signior Benedick too much;<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">but he'll be meet with you, I doubt it not.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>Messenger</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">He hath done good service, lady, in these wars.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>BEATRICE</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">You had musty victual, and he hath holp to eat it:<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">he is a very valiant trencherman; he hath an<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">excellent stomach.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>Messenger</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">And a good soldier too, lady.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>BEATRICE</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">And a good soldier to a lady: but what is he to a lord?<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>Messenger</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">A lord to a lord, a man to a man; stuffed with all<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">honourable virtues.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>BEATRICE</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">It is so, indeed; he is no less than a stuffed man:<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">but for the stuffing,--well, we are all mortal.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>LEONATO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">You must not, sir, mistake my niece. There is a<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">kind of merry war betwixt Signior Benedick and her:<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">they never meet but there's a skirmish of wit<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">between them.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>BEATRICE</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">Alas! he gets nothing by that. In our last<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">conflict four of his five wits went halting off, and<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">now is the whole man governed with one: so that if<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">he have wit enough to keep himself warm, let him<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">bear it for a difference between himself and his<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">horse; for it is all the wealth that he hath left,<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">to be known a reasonable creature. Who is his<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">companion now? He hath every month a new sworn brother.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>Messenger</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">Is't possible?<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>BEATRICE</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">Very easily possible: he wears his faith but as<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">the fashion of his hat; it ever changes with the<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">next block.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>Messenger</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">I see, lady, the gentleman is not in your books.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>BEATRICE</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">No; an he were, I would burn my study. But, I pray<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">you, who is his companion? Is there no young<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">squarer now that will make a voyage with him to the devil?<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>Messenger</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">He is most in the company of the right noble Claudio.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>BEATRICE</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">O Lord, he will hang upon him like a disease: he<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">is sooner caught than the pestilence, and the taker<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">runs presently mad. God help the noble Claudio! if<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">he have caught the Benedick, it will cost him a<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">thousand pound ere a' be cured.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>Messenger</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">I will hold friends with you, lady.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>BEATRICE</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">Do, good friend.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>LEONATO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">You will never run mad, niece.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>BEATRICE</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">No, not till a hot January.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>Messenger</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">Don Pedro is approached.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<p>
<i>Stage Direction: Enter DON PEDRO, DON JOHN, CLAUDIO, BENEDICK,
and BALTHASAR</i>
</p>
<h4>DON PEDRO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">Good Signior Leonato, you are come to meet your<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">trouble: the fashion of the world is to avoid<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">cost, and you encounter it.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>LEONATO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">Never came trouble to my house in the likeness of<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">your grace: for trouble being gone, comfort should<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">remain; but when you depart from me, sorrow abides<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">and happiness takes his leave.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>DON PEDRO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">You embrace your charge too willingly. I think this<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">is your daughter.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>LEONATO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">Her mother hath many times told me so.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>BENEDICK</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">Were you in doubt, sir, that you asked her?<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>LEONATO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">Signior Benedick, no; for then were you a child.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>DON PEDRO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">You have it full, Benedick: we may guess by this<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">what you are, being a man. Truly, the lady fathers<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">herself. Be happy, lady; for you are like an<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">honourable father.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>BENEDICK</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">If Signior Leonato be her father, she would not<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">have his head on her shoulders for all Messina, as<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">like him as she is.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>BEATRICE</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">I wonder that you will still be talking, Signior<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">Benedick: nobody marks you.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>BENEDICK</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">What, my dear Lady Disdain! are you yet living?<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>BEATRICE</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">Is it possible disdain should die while she hath<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">such meet food to feed it as Signior Benedick?<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">Courtesy itself must convert to disdain, if you come<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">in her presence.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>BENEDICK</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">Then is courtesy a turncoat. But it is certain I<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">am loved of all ladies, only you excepted: and I<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">would I could find in my heart that I had not a hard<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">heart; for, truly, I love none.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>BEATRICE</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">A dear happiness to women: they would else have<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">been troubled with a pernicious suitor. I thank God<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">and my cold blood, I am of your humour for that: I<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">had rather hear my dog bark at a crow than a man<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">swear he loves me.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>BENEDICK</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">God keep your ladyship still in that mind! so some<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">gentleman or other shall 'scape a predestinate<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">scratched face.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>BEATRICE</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">Scratching could not make it worse, an 'twere such<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">a face as yours were.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>BENEDICK</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">Well, you are a rare parrot-teacher.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>BEATRICE</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">A bird of my tongue is better than a beast of yours.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>BENEDICK</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">I would my horse had the speed of your tongue, and<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">so good a continuer. But keep your way, i' God's<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">name; I have done.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>BEATRICE</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">You always end with a jade's trick: I know you of old.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>DON PEDRO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">That is the sum of all, Leonato. Signior Claudio<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">and Signior Benedick, my dear friend Leonato hath<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">invited you all. I tell him we shall stay here at<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">the least a month; and he heartily prays some<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">occasion may detain us longer. I dare swear he is no<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">hypocrite, but prays from his heart.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>LEONATO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">If you swear, my lord, you shall not be forsworn.<br/>
</div>
				<p>
<i>Stage Direction: To DON JOHN</i>
</p>
				<div class="line">Let me bid you welcome, my lord: being reconciled to<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">the prince your brother, I owe you all duty.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>DON JOHN</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">I thank you: I am not of many words, but I thank<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">you.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>LEONATO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">Please it your grace lead on?<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>DON PEDRO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">Your hand, Leonato; we will go together.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<p>
<i>Stage Direction: Exeunt all except BENEDICK and CLAUDIO</i>
</p>
<h4>CLAUDIO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">Benedick, didst thou note the daughter of Signior Leonato?<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>BENEDICK</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">I noted her not; but I looked on her.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>CLAUDIO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">Is she not a modest young lady?<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>BENEDICK</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">Do you question me, as an honest man should do, for<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">my simple true judgment; or would you have me speak<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">after my custom, as being a professed tyrant to their sex?<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>CLAUDIO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">No; I pray thee speak in sober judgment.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>BENEDICK</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">Why, i' faith, methinks she's too low for a high<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">praise, too brown for a fair praise and too little<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">for a great praise: only this commendation I can<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">afford her, that were she other than she is, she<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">were unhandsome; and being no other but as she is, I<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">do not like her.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>CLAUDIO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">Thou thinkest I am in sport: I pray thee tell me<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">truly how thou likest her.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>BENEDICK</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">Would you buy her, that you inquire after her?<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>CLAUDIO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">Can the world buy such a jewel?<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>BENEDICK</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">Yea, and a case to put it into. But speak you this<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">with a sad brow? or do you play the flouting Jack,<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">to tell us Cupid is a good hare-finder and Vulcan a<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">rare carpenter? Come, in what key shall a man take<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">you, to go in the song?<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>CLAUDIO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">In mine eye she is the sweetest lady that ever I<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">looked on.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>BENEDICK</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">I can see yet without spectacles and I see no such<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">matter: there's her cousin, an she were not<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">possessed with a fury, exceeds her as much in beauty<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">as the first of May doth the last of December. But I<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">hope you have no intent to turn husband, have you?<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>CLAUDIO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">I would scarce trust myself, though I had sworn the<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">contrary, if Hero would be my wife.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>BENEDICK</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">Is't come to this? In faith, hath not the world<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">one man but he will wear his cap with suspicion?<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">Shall I never see a bachelor of three-score again?<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">Go to, i' faith; an thou wilt needs thrust thy neck<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">into a yoke, wear the print of it and sigh away<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">Sundays. Look Don Pedro is returned to seek you.<br/>

</div>
			</p>
<h4>BENEDICK</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">I would your grace would constrain me to tell.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>DON PEDRO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">I charge thee on thy allegiance.<br/>

			</p>
<h4>BENEDICK</h4>

				<div class="line">You hear, Count Claudio: I can be secret as a dumb<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">man; I would have you think so; but, on my<br/>

				<div class="line">If this were so, so were it uttered.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>BENEDICK</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">Like the old tale, my lord: 'it is not so, nor<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">'twas not so, but, indeed, God forbid it should be<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">so.'<br/>
</div>

<h4>CLAUDIO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">If my passion change not shortly, God forbid it<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">should be otherwise.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>DON PEDRO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">Amen, if you love her; for the lady is very well worthy.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>CLAUDIO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">You speak this to fetch me in, my lord.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>DON PEDRO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">By my troth, I speak my thought.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>CLAUDIO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">And, in faith, my lord, I spoke mine.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>BENEDICK</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">And, by my two faiths and troths, my lord, I spoke mine.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>CLAUDIO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">That I love her, I feel.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>DON PEDRO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">That she is worthy, I know.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>BENEDICK</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">That I neither feel how she should be loved nor<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">know how she should be worthy, is the opinion that<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">fire cannot melt out of me: I will die in it at the stake.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>DON PEDRO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">Thou wast ever an obstinate heretic in the despite<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">of beauty.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>CLAUDIO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">And never could maintain his part but in the force<br/>

<h4>BENEDICK</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">That a woman conceived me, I thank her; that she<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">brought me up, I likewise give her most humble<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">thanks: but that I will have a recheat winded in my<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">forehead, or hang my bugle in an invisible baldrick,<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">all women shall pardon me. Because I will not do<br/>
</div>

</div>
				<div class="line">right to trust none; and the fine is, for the which<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">I may go the finer, I will live a bachelor.<br/>
</div>

<h4>DON PEDRO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">I shall see thee, ere I die, look pale with love.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>BENEDICK</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">With anger, with sickness, or with hunger, my lord,<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">not with love: prove that ever I lose more blood<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">with love than I will get again with drinking, pick<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">out mine eyes with a ballad-maker's pen and hang me<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">up at the door of a brothel-house for the sign of<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">blind Cupid.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>DON PEDRO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">Well, if ever thou dost fall from this faith, thou<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">wilt prove a notable argument.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>BENEDICK</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">If I do, hang me in a bottle like a cat and shoot<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">at me; and he that hits me, let him be clapped on<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">the shoulder, and called Adam.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>DON PEDRO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">Well, as time shall try: 'In time the savage bull<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">doth bear the yoke.'<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>BENEDICK</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">The savage bull may; but if ever the sensible<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">Benedick bear it, pluck off the bull's horns and set<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">them in my forehead: and let me be vilely painted,<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">and in such great letters as they write 'Here is<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">good horse to hire,' let them signify under my sign<br/>
</div>

</div>

<h4>CLAUDIO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">If this should ever happen, thou wouldst be horn-mad.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>DON PEDRO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">Nay, if Cupid have not spent all his quiver in<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">Venice, thou wilt quake for this shortly.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>BENEDICK</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">I look for an earthquake too, then.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>DON PEDRO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">Well, you temporize with the hours. In the<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">meantime, good Signior Benedick, repair to<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">Leonato's: commend me to him and tell him I will<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">not fail him at supper; for indeed he hath made<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">great preparation.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>BENEDICK</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">I have almost matter enough in me for such an<br/>

</div>
				<div class="line">That liked, but had a rougher task in hand<br/>

<h4>ANTONIO</h4>

<h4>CONRADE</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">What the good-year, my lord! why are you thus out<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">of measure sad?<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>DON JOHN</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">There is no measure in the occasion that breeds;<br/>

			</p>
<h4>CONRADE</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">You should hear reason.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>DON JOHN</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">And when I have heard it, what blessing brings it?<br/>

<h4>CONRADE</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">If not a present remedy, at least a patient<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">sufferance.<br/>

			</p>
<h4>DON JOHN</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">I wonder that thou, being, as thou sayest thou art,<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">born under Saturn, goest about to apply a moral<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">medicine to a mortifying mischief. I cannot hide<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">what I am: I must be sad when I have cause and smile<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">at no man's jests, eat when I have stomach and wait<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">for no man's leisure, sleep when I am drowsy and<br/>
</div>

</div>

<h4>CONRADE</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">Yea, but you must not make the full show of this<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">till you may do it without controlment. You have of<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">late stood out against your brother, and he hath<br/>
</div>

</div>
				<div class="line">impossible you should take true root but by the<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">fair weather that you make yourself: it is needful<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">that you frame the season for your own harvest.<br/>

			</p>
<h4>DON JOHN</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">I had rather be a canker in a hedge than a rose in<br/>
</div>

</div>
				<div class="line">disdained of all than to fashion a carriage to rob<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">love from any: in this, though I cannot be said to<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">be a flattering honest man, it must not be denied<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">but I am a plain-dealing villain. I am trusted with<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">a muzzle and enfranchised with a clog; therefore I<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">have decreed not to sing in my cage. If I had my<br/>

<h4>BORACHIO</h4>

</div>
				<div class="line">can give you intelligence of an intended marriage.<br/>
</div>

<h4>DON JOHN</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">Will it serve for any model to build mischief on?<br/>

				<div class="line">A very forward March-chick! How came you to this?<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>BORACHIO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">Being entertained for a perfumer, as I was smoking a<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">musty room, comes me the prince and Claudio, hand<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">in hand in sad conference: I whipt me behind the<br/>

</div>
				<div class="line">greater that I am subdued. Would the cook were of<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">my mind! Shall we go prove what's to be done?<br/>

<h4>LEONATO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">Was not Count John here at supper?<br/>

<h4>ANTONIO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">I saw him not.<br/>

<h4>BEATRICE</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">How tartly that gentleman looks! I never can see<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">him but I am heart-burned an hour after.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>HERO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">He is of a very melancholy disposition.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>BEATRICE</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">He were an excellent man that were made just in the<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">midway between him and Benedick: the one is too<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">like an image and says nothing, and the other too<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">like my lady's eldest son, evermore tattling.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>LEONATO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">Then half Signior Benedick's tongue in Count John's<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">mouth, and half Count John's melancholy in Signior<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">Benedick's face,--<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>BEATRICE</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">With a good leg and a good foot, uncle, and money<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">enough in his purse, such a man would win any woman<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">in the world, if a' could get her good-will.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>LEONATO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">By my troth, niece, thou wilt never get thee a<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">husband, if thou be so shrewd of thy tongue.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>ANTONIO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">In faith, she's too curst.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>BEATRICE</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">Too curst is more than curst: I shall lessen God's<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">sending that way; for it is said, 'God sends a curst<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">cow short horns;' but to a cow too curst he sends none.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>LEONATO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">So, by being too curst, God will send you no horns.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>BEATRICE</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">Just, if he send me no husband; for the which<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">blessing I am at him upon my knees every morning and<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">evening. Lord, I could not endure a husband with a<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">beard on his face: I had rather lie in the woollen.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>LEONATO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">You may light on a husband that hath no beard.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>BEATRICE</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">What should I do with him? dress him in my apparel<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">and make him my waiting-gentlewoman? He that hath a<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">beard is more than a youth, and he that hath no<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">beard is less than a man: and he that is more than<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">a youth is not for me, and he that is less than a<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">man, I am not for him: therefore, I will even take<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">sixpence in earnest of the bear-ward, and lead his<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">apes into hell.<br/>

<h4>LEONATO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">By my troth, my lord, I cannot tell what to think<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">of it but that she loves him with an enraged<br/>

<h4>LEONATO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">O God, counterfeit! There was never counterfeit of<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">passion came so near the life of passion as she<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">discovers it.<br/>
</div>

<h4>LEONATO</h4>

				<div class="line">What effects, my lord? She will sit you, you heard<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">my daughter tell you how.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>CLAUDIO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">She did, indeed.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>DON PEDRO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">How, how, pray you? You amaze me: I would have I<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">thought her spirit had been invincible against all<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">assaults of affection.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>LEONATO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">I would have sworn it had, my lord; especially<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">against Benedick.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>BENEDICK</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">I should think this a gull, but that the<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">white-bearded fellow speaks it: knavery cannot,<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">sure, hide himself in such reverence.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>CLAUDIO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">He hath ta'en the infection: hold it up.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>DON PEDRO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">Hath she made her affection known to Benedick?<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>LEONATO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">No; and swears she never will: that's her torment.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>CLAUDIO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">'Tis true, indeed; so your daughter says: 'Shall<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">I,' says she, 'that have so oft encountered him<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">with scorn, write to him that I love him?'<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>LEONATO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">This says she now when she is beginning to write to<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">him; for she'll be up twenty times a night, and<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">there will she sit in her smock till she have writ a<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">sheet of paper: my daughter tells us all.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>CLAUDIO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">Now you talk of a sheet of paper, I remember a<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">pretty jest your daughter told us of.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>LEONATO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">O, when she had writ it and was reading it over, she<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">found Benedick and Beatrice between the sheet?<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>CLAUDIO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">That.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>LEONATO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">O, she tore the letter into a thousand halfpence;<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">railed at herself, that she should be so immodest<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">to write to one that she knew would flout her; 'I<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">measure him,' says she, 'by my own spirit; for I<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">should flout him, if he writ to me; yea, though I<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">love him, I should.'<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>CLAUDIO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">Then down upon her knees she falls, weeps, sobs,<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">beats her heart, tears her hair, prays, curses; 'O<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">sweet Benedick! God give me patience!'<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>LEONATO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">She doth indeed; my daughter says so: and the<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">ecstasy hath so much overborne her that my daughter<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">is sometime afeared she will do a desperate outrage<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">to herself: it is very true.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>DON PEDRO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">It were good that Benedick knew of it by some<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">other, if she will not discover it.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>CLAUDIO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">To what end? He would make but a sport of it and<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">torment the poor lady worse.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>DON PEDRO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">An he should, it were an alms to hang him. She's an<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">excellent sweet lady; and, out of all suspicion,<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">she is virtuous.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>CLAUDIO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">And she is exceeding wise.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>DON PEDRO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">In every thing but in loving Benedick.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>LEONATO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">O, my lord, wisdom and blood combating in so tender<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">a body, we have ten proofs to one that blood hath<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">the victory. I am sorry for her, as I have just<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">cause, being her uncle and her guardian.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>DON PEDRO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">I would she had bestowed this dotage on me: I would<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">have daffed all other respects and made her half<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">myself. I pray you, tell Benedick of it, and hear<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">what a' will say.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>LEONATO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">Were it good, think you?<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>CLAUDIO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">Hero thinks surely she will die; for she says she<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">will die, if he love her not, and she will die, ere<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">she make her love known, and she will die, if he woo<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">her, rather than she will bate one breath of her<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">accustomed crossness.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>DON PEDRO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">She doth well: if she should make tender of her<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">love, 'tis very possible he'll scorn it; for the<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">man, as you know all, hath a contemptible spirit.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>CLAUDIO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">He is a very proper man.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>DON PEDRO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">He hath indeed a good outward happiness.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>CLAUDIO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">Before God! and, in my mind, very wise.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>DON PEDRO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">He doth indeed show some sparks that are like wit.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>CLAUDIO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">And I take him to be valiant.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>DON PEDRO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">As Hector, I assure you: and in the managing of<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">quarrels you may say he is wise; for either he<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">avoids them with great discretion, or undertakes<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">them with a most Christian-like fear.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>LEONATO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">If he do fear God, a' must necessarily keep peace:<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">if he break the peace, he ought to enter into a<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">quarrel with fear and trembling.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>DON PEDRO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">And so will he do; for the man doth fear God,<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">howsoever it seems not in him by some large jests<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">he will make. Well I am sorry for your niece. Shall<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">we go seek Benedick, and tell him of her love?<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>CLAUDIO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">Never tell him, my lord: let her wear it out with<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">good counsel.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>LEONATO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">Nay, that's impossible: she may wear her heart out first.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>DON PEDRO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">Well, we will hear further of it by your daughter:<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">let it cool the while. I love Benedick well; and I<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">could wish he would modestly examine himself, to see<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">how much he is unworthy so good a lady.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>LEONATO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">My lord, will you walk? dinner is ready.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>CLAUDIO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">If he do not dote on her upon this, I will never<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">trust my expectation.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>DON PEDRO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">Let there be the same net spread for her; and that<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">must your daughter and her gentlewomen carry. The<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">sport will be, when they hold one an opinion of<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">another's dotage, and no such matter: that's the<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">scene that I would see, which will be merely a<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">dumb-show. Let us send her to call him in to dinner.<br/>

					Coming forward  This can be no trick: the<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">conference was sadly borne. They have the truth of<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">this from Hero. They seem to pity the lady: it<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">seems her affections have their full bent. Love me!<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">why, it must be requited. I hear how I am censured:<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">they say I will bear myself proudly, if I perceive<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">the love come from her; they say too that she will<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">rather die than give any sign of affection. I did<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">never think to marry: I must not seem proud: happy<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">are they that hear their detractions and can put<br/>
</div>

</div>

</div>
				<div class="line">so, I cannot reprove it; and wise, but for loving<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">me; by my troth, it is no addition to her wit, nor<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">no great argument of her folly, for I will be<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">horribly in love with her. I may chance have some<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">odd quirks and remnants of wit broken on me,<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">because I have railed so long against marriage: but<br/>

<h4>HERO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">Good Margaret, run thee to the parlor;<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">There shalt thou find my cousin Beatrice<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">Proposing with the prince and Claudio:<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">Whisper her ear and tell her, I and Ursula<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">Walk in the orchard and our whole discourse<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">Is all of her; say that thou overheard'st us;<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">And bid her steal into the pleached bower,<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">Where honeysuckles, ripen'd by the sun,<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">Forbid the sun to enter, like favourites,<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">Made proud by princes, that advance their pride<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">Against that power that bred it: there will she hide her,<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">To listen our purpose.  This is thy office;<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">Bear thee well in it and leave us alone.<br/>
</div>

				<div class="line">I'll make her come, I warrant you, presently.<br/>

<h4>HERO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">Now, Ursula, when Beatrice doth come,<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">As we do trace this alley up and down,<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">Our talk must only be of Benedick.<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">When I do name him, let it be thy part<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">To praise him more than ever man did merit:<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">My talk to thee must be how Benedick<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">Is sick in love with Beatrice. Of this matter<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">Is little Cupid's crafty arrow made,<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">That only wounds by hearsay.<br/>
</div>
				<p>
<i>Stage Direction: Enter BEATRICE, behind</i>
</p>
				<div class="line">Now begin;<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">For look where Beatrice, like a lapwing, runs<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">Close by the ground, to hear our conference.<br/>

			</p>
<h4>URSULA</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">The pleasant'st angling is to see the fish<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">Cut with her golden oars the silver stream,<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">And greedily devour the treacherous bait:<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">So angle we for Beatrice; who even now<br/>

<p>
				
				<div class="line">Then go we near her, that her ear lose nothing<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">Of the false sweet bait that we lay for it.<br/>
</div>
				<p>
<i>Stage Direction: Approaching the bower</i>
</p>
				<div class="line">No, truly, Ursula, she is too disdainful;<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">I know her spirits are as coy and wild<br/>

				<div class="line">As haggerds of the rock.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>URSULA</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">But are you sure<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">That Benedick loves Beatrice so entirely?<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>HERO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">So says the prince and my new-trothed lord.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>URSULA</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">And did they bid you tell her of it, madam?<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>HERO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">They did entreat me to acquaint her of it;<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">But I persuaded them, if they loved Benedick,<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">To wish him wrestle with affection,<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">And never to let Beatrice know of it.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>URSULA</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">Why did you so? Doth not the gentleman<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">Deserve as full as fortunate a bed<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">As ever Beatrice shall couch upon?<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>HERO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">O god of love! I know he doth deserve<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">As much as may be yielded to a man:<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">But Nature never framed a woman's heart<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">Of prouder stuff than that of Beatrice;<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">Disdain and scorn ride sparkling in her eyes,<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">Misprising what they look on, and her wit<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">Values itself so highly that to her<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">All matter else seems weak: she cannot love,<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">Nor take no shape nor project of affection,<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">She is so self-endeared.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>URSULA</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">Sure, I think so;<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">And therefore certainly it were not good<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">She knew his love, lest she make sport at it.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>HERO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">Why, you speak truth. I never yet saw man,<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">How wise, how noble, young, how rarely featured,<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">But she would spell him backward: if fair-faced,<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">She would swear the gentleman should be her sister;<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">If black, why, Nature, drawing of an antique,<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">Made a foul blot; if tall, a lance ill-headed;<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">If low, an agate very vilely cut;<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">If speaking, why, a vane blown with all winds;<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">If silent, why, a block moved with none.<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">So turns she every man the wrong side out<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">And never gives to truth and virtue that<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">Which simpleness and merit purchaseth.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>URSULA</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">Sure, sure, such carping is not commendable.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>HERO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">No, not to be so odd and from all fashions<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">As Beatrice is, cannot be commendable:<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">But who dare tell her so? If I should speak,<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">She would mock me into air; O, she would laugh me<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">Out of myself, press me to death with wit.<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">Therefore let Benedick, like cover'd fire,<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">Consume away in sighs, waste inwardly:<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">It were a better death than die with mocks,<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">Which is as bad as die with tickling.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>URSULA</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">Yet tell her of it: hear what she will say.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>HERO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">No; rather I will go to Benedick<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">And counsel him to fight against his passion.<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">And, truly, I'll devise some honest slanders<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">To stain my cousin with: one doth not know<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">How much an ill word may empoison liking.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>URSULA</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">O, do not do your cousin such a wrong.<br/>
</div>

<h3>SCENE II.  A room in LEONATO'S house</h3>

<p>
<i>Stage Direction: Enter DON PEDRO, CLAUDIO, BENEDICK, and LEONATO</i>
</p>
<h4>DON PEDRO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">I do but stay till your marriage be consummate, and<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">then go I toward Arragon.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>CLAUDIO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">I'll bring you thither, my lord, if you'll<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">vouchsafe me.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>DON PEDRO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">Nay, that would be as great a soil in the new gloss<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">of your marriage as to show a child his new coat<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">and forbid him to wear it. I will only be bold<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">with Benedick for his company; for, from the crown<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">of his head to the sole of his foot, he is all<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">mirth: he hath twice or thrice cut Cupid's<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">bow-string and the little hangman dare not shoot at<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">him; he hath a heart as sound as a bell and his<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">tongue is the clapper, for what his heart thinks his<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">tongue speaks.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>BENEDICK</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">Gallants, I am not as I have been.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>LEONATO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">So say I methinks you are sadder.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>CLAUDIO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">I hope he be in love.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>DON PEDRO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">Hang him, truant! there's no true drop of blood in<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">him, to be truly touched with love: if he be sad,<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">he wants money.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>BENEDICK</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">I have the toothache.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>DON PEDRO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">Draw it.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>BENEDICK</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">Hang it!<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>CLAUDIO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">You must hang it first, and draw it afterwards.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>DON PEDRO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">What! sigh for the toothache?<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>LEONATO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">Where is but a humour or a worm.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>BENEDICK</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">Well, every one can master a grief but he that has<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">it.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>CLAUDIO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">Yet say I, he is in love.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>DON PEDRO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">There is no appearance of fancy in him, unless it be<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">a fancy that he hath to strange disguises; as, to be<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">a Dutchman today, a Frenchman to-morrow, or in the<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">shape of two countries at once, as, a German from<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">the waist downward, all slops, and a Spaniard from<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">the hip upward, no doublet. Unless he have a fancy<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">to this foolery, as it appears he hath, he is no<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">fool for fancy, as you would have it appear he is.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>CLAUDIO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">If he be not in love with some woman, there is no<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">believing old signs: a' brushes his hat o'<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">mornings; what should that bode?<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>DON PEDRO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">Hath any man seen him at the barber's?<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>CLAUDIO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">No, but the barber's man hath been seen with him,<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">and the old ornament of his cheek hath already<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">stuffed tennis-balls.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>LEONATO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">Indeed, he looks younger than he did, by the loss of a beard.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>DON PEDRO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">Nay, a' rubs himself with civet: can you smell him<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">out by that?<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>CLAUDIO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">That's as much as to say, the sweet youth's in love.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>DON PEDRO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">The greatest note of it is his melancholy.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>CLAUDIO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">And when was he wont to wash his face?<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>DON PEDRO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">Yea, or to paint himself? for the which, I hear<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">what they say of him.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>CLAUDIO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">Nay, but his jesting spirit; which is now crept into<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">a lute-string and now governed by stops.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>DON PEDRO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">Indeed, that tells a heavy tale for him: conclude,<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">conclude he is in love.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>CLAUDIO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">Nay, but I know who loves him.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>DON PEDRO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">That would I know too: I warrant, one that knows him not.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>CLAUDIO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">Yes, and his ill conditions; and, in despite of<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">all, dies for him.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>DON PEDRO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">She shall be buried with her face upwards.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>BENEDICK</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">Yet is this no charm for the toothache. Old<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">signior, walk aside with me: I have studied eight<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">or nine wise words to speak to you, which these<br/>

				<div class="line">'Tis even so. Hero and Margaret have by this<br/>

				<div class="line">Are you good men and true?<br/>

<h4>VERGES</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">Yea, or else it were pity but they should suffer<br/>

				<div class="line">salvation, body and soul.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>DOGBERRY</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">Nay, that were a punishment too good for them, if<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">they should have any allegiance in them, being<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">chosen for the prince's watch.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>VERGES</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">Well, give them their charge, neighbour Dogberry.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>DOGBERRY</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">First, who think you the most desertless man to be<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">constable?<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>First Watchman</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">Hugh Otecake, sir, or George Seacole; for they can<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">write and read.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>DOGBERRY</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">Come hither, neighbour Seacole. God hath blessed<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">you with a good name: to be a well-favoured man is<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">the gift of fortune; but to write and read comes by nature.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>Second Watchman</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">Both which, master constable,--<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>DOGBERRY</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">You have: I knew it would be your answer. Well,<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">for your favour, sir, why, give God thanks, and make<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">no boast of it; and for your writing and reading,<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">let that appear when there is no need of such<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">vanity. You are thought here to be the most<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">senseless and fit man for the constable of the<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">watch; therefore bear you the lantern. This is your<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">charge: you shall comprehend all vagrom men; you are<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">to bid any man stand, in the prince's name.<br/>
</div>

<h4>Second Watchman</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">How if a' will not stand?<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>DOGBERRY</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">Why, then, take no note of him, but let him go; and<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">presently call the rest of the watch together and<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">thank God you are rid of a knave.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>VERGES</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">If he will not stand when he is bidden, he is none<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">of the prince's subjects.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>DOGBERRY</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">True, and they are to meddle with none but the<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">prince's subjects. You shall also make no noise in<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">the streets; for, for the watch to babble and to<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">talk is most tolerable and not to be endured.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>Watchman</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">We will rather sleep than talk: we know what<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">belongs to a watch.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>DOGBERRY</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">Why, you speak like an ancient and most quiet<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">watchman; for I cannot see how sleeping should<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">offend: only, have a care that your bills be not<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">stolen. Well, you are to call at all the<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">ale-houses, and bid those that are drunk get them to bed.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>Watchman</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">How if they will not?<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>DOGBERRY</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">Why, then, let them alone till they are sober: if<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">they make you not then the better answer, you may<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">say they are not the men you took them for.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>Watchman</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">Well, sir.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>DOGBERRY</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">If you meet a thief, you may suspect him, by virtue<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">of your office, to be no true man; and, for such<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">kind of men, the less you meddle or make with them,<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">why the more is for your honesty.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>Watchman</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">If we know him to be a thief, shall we not lay<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">hands on him?<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>DOGBERRY</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">Truly, by your office, you may; but I think they<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">that touch pitch will be defiled: the most peaceable<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">way for you, if you do take a thief, is to let him<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">show himself what he is and steal out of your company.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>VERGES</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">You have been always called a merciful man, partner.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>DOGBERRY</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">Truly, I would not hang a dog by my will, much more<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">a man who hath any honesty in him.<br/>
</div>

<h4>VERGES</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">If you hear a child cry in the night, you must call<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">to the nurse and bid her still it.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>Watchman</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">How if the nurse be asleep and will not hear us?<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>DOGBERRY</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">Why, then, depart in peace, and let the child wake<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">her with crying; for the ewe that will not hear her<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">lamb when it baes will never answer a calf when he bleats.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>VERGES</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">'Tis very true.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>DOGBERRY</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">This is the end of the charge:--you, constable, are<br/>

</div>
				<div class="line">the prince be willing; for, indeed, the watch ought<br/>

<h4>BORACHIO</h4>
<p>

</div>
				<div class="line">by his oaths, which first possessed them, partly by<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">the dark night, which did deceive them, but chiefly<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">by my villany, which did confirm any slander that<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">Don John had made, away went Claudio enraged; swore<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">he would meet her, as he was appointed, next morning<br/>
</div>

<h4>LEONATO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">Come, Friar Francis, be brief; only to the plain<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">form of marriage, and you shall recount their<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">particular duties afterwards.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>FRIAR FRANCIS</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">You come hither, my lord, to marry this lady.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>CLAUDIO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">No.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>LEONATO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">To be married to her: friar, you come to marry her.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>FRIAR FRANCIS</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">Lady, you come hither to be married to this count.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>HERO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">I do.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>FRIAR FRANCIS</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">If either of you know any inward impediment why you<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">should not be conjoined, charge you, on your souls,<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">to utter it.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>CLAUDIO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">Know you any, Hero?<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>HERO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">None, my lord.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>FRIAR FRANCIS</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">Know you any, count?<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>LEONATO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">I dare make his answer, none.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>CLAUDIO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">O, what men dare do! what men may do! what men daily<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">do, not knowing what they do!<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>BENEDICK</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">How now! interjections? Why, then, some be of<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">laughing, as, ah, ha, he!<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>CLAUDIO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">Stand thee by, friar. Father, by your leave:<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">Will you with free and unconstrained soul<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">Give me this maid, your daughter?<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>LEONATO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">As freely, son, as God did give her me.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>CLAUDIO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">And what have I to give you back, whose worth<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">May counterpoise this rich and precious gift?<br/>
</div>

<h4>DON PEDRO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">Nothing, unless you render her again.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>CLAUDIO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">Sweet prince, you learn me noble thankfulness.<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">There, Leonato, take her back again:<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">Give not this rotten orange to your friend;<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">She's but the sign and semblance of her honour.<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">Behold how like a maid she blushes here!<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">O, what authority and show of truth<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">Can cunning sin cover itself withal!<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">Comes not that blood as modest evidence<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">To witness simple virtue? Would you not swear,<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">All you that see her, that she were a maid,<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">By these exterior shows? But she is none:<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">She knows the heat of a luxurious bed;<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">Her blush is guiltiness, not modesty.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>LEONATO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">What do you mean, my lord?<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>CLAUDIO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">Not to be married,<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">Not to knit my soul to an approved wanton.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>LEONATO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">Dear my lord, if you, in your own proof,<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">Have vanquish'd the resistance of her youth,<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">And made defeat of her virginity,--<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>CLAUDIO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">I know what you would say: if I have known her,<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">You will say she did embrace me as a husband,<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">And so extenuate the 'forehand sin:<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">No, Leonato,<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">I never tempted her with word too large;<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">But, as a brother to his sister, show'd<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">Bashful sincerity and comely love.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>HERO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">And seem'd I ever otherwise to you?<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>CLAUDIO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">Out on thee! Seeming! I will write against it:<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">You seem to me as Dian in her orb,<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">As chaste as is the bud ere it be blown;<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">But you are more intemperate in your blood<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">Than Venus, or those pamper'd animals<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">That rage in savage sensuality.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>HERO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">Is my lord well, that he doth speak so wide?<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>LEONATO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">Sweet prince, why speak not you?<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>DON PEDRO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">What should I speak?<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">I stand dishonour'd, that have gone about<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">To link my dear friend to a common stale.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>LEONATO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">Are these things spoken, or do I but dream?<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>DON JOHN</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">Sir, they are spoken, and these things are true.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>BENEDICK</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">This looks not like a nuptial.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>HERO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">True! O God!<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>CLAUDIO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">Leonato, stand I here?<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">Is this the prince? is this the prince's brother?<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">Is this face Hero's? are our eyes our own?<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>LEONATO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">All this is so: but what of this, my lord?<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>CLAUDIO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">Let me but move one question to your daughter;<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">And, by that fatherly and kindly power<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">That you have in her, bid her answer truly.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>LEONATO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">I charge thee do so, as thou art my child.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>HERO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">O, God defend me! how am I beset!<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">What kind of catechising call you this?<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>CLAUDIO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">To make you answer truly to your name.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>HERO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">Is it not Hero? Who can blot that name<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">With any just reproach?<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>CLAUDIO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">Marry, that can Hero;<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">Hero itself can blot out Hero's virtue.<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">What man was he talk'd with you yesternight<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">Out at your window betwixt twelve and one?<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">Now, if you are a maid, answer to this.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>HERO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">I talk'd with no man at that hour, my lord.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>DON PEDRO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">Why, then are you no maiden. Leonato,<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">I am sorry you must hear: upon mine honour,<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">Myself, my brother and this grieved count<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">Did see her, hear her, at that hour last night<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">Talk with a ruffian at her chamber-window<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">Who hath indeed, most like a liberal villain,<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">Confess'd the vile encounters they have had<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">A thousand times in secret.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>DON JOHN</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">Fie, fie! they are not to be named, my lord,<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">Not to be spoke of;<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">There is not chastity enough in language<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">Without offence to utter them. Thus, pretty lady,<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">I am sorry for thy much misgovernment.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>CLAUDIO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">O Hero, what a Hero hadst thou been,<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">If half thy outward graces had been placed<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">About thy thoughts and counsels of thy heart!<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">But fare thee well, most foul, most fair! farewell,<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">Thou pure impiety and impious purity!<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">For thee I'll lock up all the gates of love,<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">And on my eyelids shall conjecture hang,<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">To turn all beauty into thoughts of harm,<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">And never shall it more be gracious.<br/>

<p>
				
				<div class="line">Yea, wherefore should she not?<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>LEONATO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">Wherefore! Why, doth not every earthly thing<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">Cry shame upon her? Could she here deny<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">The story that is printed in her blood?<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">Do not live, Hero; do not ope thine eyes:<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">For, did I think thou wouldst not quickly die,<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">Thought I thy spirits were stronger than thy shames,<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">Myself would, on the rearward of reproaches,<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">Strike at thy life. Grieved I, I had but one?<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">Chid I for that at frugal nature's frame?<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">O, one too much by thee! Why had I one?<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">Why ever wast thou lovely in my eyes?<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">Why had I not with charitable hand<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">Took up a beggar's issue at my gates,<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">Who smirch'd thus and mired with infamy,<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">I might have said 'No part of it is mine;<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">This shame derives itself from unknown loins'?<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">But mine and mine I loved and mine I praised<br/>

</div>

				<div class="line">Hath drops too few to wash her clean again<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">And salt too little which may season give<br/>

</div>
				<div class="line">Which was before barr'd up with ribs of iron!<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">Would the two princes lie, and Claudio lie,<br/>
</div>

			</p>
<h4>FRIAR FRANCIS</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">Hear me a little; for I have only been<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">Silent so long and given way unto<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">This course of fortune<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">By noting of the lady. I have mark'd<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">A thousand blushing apparitions<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">To start into her face, a thousand innocent shames<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">In angel whiteness beat away those blushes;<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">And in her eye there hath appear'd a fire,<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">To burn the errors that these princes hold<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">Against her maiden truth. Call me a fool;<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">Trust not my reading nor my observations,<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">Which with experimental seal doth warrant<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">The tenor of my book; trust not my age,<br/>
</div>

				<div class="line">Friar, it cannot be.<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">Thou seest that all the grace that she hath left<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">Is that she will not add to her damnation<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">A sin of perjury; she not denies it:<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">Why seek'st thou then to cover with excuse<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">That which appears in proper nakedness?<br/>
</div>

<h4>FRIAR FRANCIS</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">Lady, what man is he you are accused of?<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>HERO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">They know that do accuse me; I know none:<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">If I know more of any man alive<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">Than that which maiden modesty doth warrant,<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">Let all my sins lack mercy! O my father,<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">Prove you that any man with me conversed<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">At hours unmeet, or that I yesternight<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">Maintain'd the change of words with any creature,<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">Refuse me, hate me, torture me to death!<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>FRIAR FRANCIS</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">There is some strange misprision in the princes.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>BENEDICK</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">Two of them have the very bent of honour;<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">And if their wisdoms be misled in this,<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">The practise of it lives in John the bastard,<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">Whose spirits toil in frame of villanies.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>LEONATO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">I know not. If they speak but truth of her,<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">These hands shall tear her; if they wrong her honour,<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">The proudest of them shall well hear of it.<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">Time hath not yet so dried this blood of mine,<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">Nor age so eat up my invention,<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">Nor fortune made such havoc of my means,<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">Nor my bad life reft me so much of friends,<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">But they shall find, awaked in such a kind,<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">Both strength of limb and policy of mind,<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">Ability in means and choice of friends,<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">To quit me of them throughly.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>FRIAR FRANCIS</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">Pause awhile,<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">And let my counsel sway you in this case.<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">Your daughter here the princes left for dead:<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">Let her awhile be secretly kept in,<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">And publish it that she is dead indeed;<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">Maintain a mourning ostentation<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">And on your family's old monument<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">Hang mournful epitaphs and do all rites<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">That appertain unto a burial.<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>LEONATO</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">What shall become of this? what will this do?<br/>
</div>
			</p>
<h4>FRIAR FRANCIS</h4>
<p>
				
				<div class="line">Marry, this well carried shall on her behalf<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">Change slander to remorse; that is some good:<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">But not for that dream I on this strange course,<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">But on this travail look for greater birth.<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">She dying, as it must so be maintain'd,<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">Upon the instant that she was accused,<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">Shall be lamented, pitied and excused<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">Of every hearer: for it so falls out<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">That what we have we prize not to the worth<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">Whiles we enjoy it, but being lack'd and lost,<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">Why, then we rack the value, then we find<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">The virtue that possession would not show us<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">Whiles it was ours. So will it fare with Claudio:<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">When he shall hear she died upon his words,<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">The idea of her life shall sweetly creep<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">Into his study of imagination,<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">And every lovely organ of her life<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">Shall come apparell'd in more precious habit,<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">More moving-delicate and full of life,<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">Into the eye and prospect of his soul,<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">Than when she lived indeed; then shall he mourn,<br/>
</div>
				<div class="line">If ever love had interest in his liver,<br/>
</div>

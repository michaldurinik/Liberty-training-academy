		<h1>The Flight Booking Application</h1>
		<p>
			This is a prototype application for booking flights, built using Spring MVC. The
			basic functionality is as follows:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>On the first page you enter where you want to fly from and to, with the associated dates</li>
			<li>You are then presented with all the matching flights, and choose which ones you want</li>
			<li>Finally you are presented with a confirmation or failure page.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			The packages used in the code are presented below:

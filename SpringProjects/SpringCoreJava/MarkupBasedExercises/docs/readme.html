        <h1>Spring Markup Driven Exercises</h1>
        <p>
            Examine the package <i>exercise.start</i>. This contains the flight booking system we used on 
            previous exercises, except that now we are using a <b>ClassPathXmlApplicationContext</b> which 
            reads from the file <b>exerciseStart.xml</b>. At the moment all that is being done in the XML 
            file is enabling component scanning - all DI is still done via annotations.
        </p>
        <h2>Exercise One</h2>
        <p>
        		Introduce XML based dependency injection for:
        </p>
        <ol>
        		<li>Injecting the <b>BookingControllerMock</b> into the <b>FlightBookingGUI</b></li>
        		<li>Injecting the <b>FlightSearchEngineMock</b> and <b>FlightBookingServiceMock</b> into the <b>BookingControllerMock</b> </li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Exercise Two</h2>
        <p>
            Extend your solution to Exercise One by introducing XML based dependency injection for the <b>FlightBookingGUI</b> constructor. This should remove all 
            DI related annotations from the code and enable you to take component scanning 
            out of the XML file.
